# Want to find a path? Visualize It!

## Topic

**Visualization of Various Informed and Uninformed Search Algorithms**  

This project involves creating a program that visualizes the following search algorithms:  
- Uninformed Search: **DFS (Depth-First Search)**, **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**  
- Informed Search: **Greedy Search**, **A\***, **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**  

The goal is to help users understand the inner workings of these algorithms through animation and statistical data.

## Features and Requirements

### Features
1. **Side-by-Side Visualization:**  
   Users can select two algorithms to run simultaneously for comparison. The animations play side-by-side, allowing users to observe their behavior.

2. **Statistical Data:**  
   The following metrics are displayed for each algorithm:
   - **Execution Time:** How long the algorithm takes to complete.
   - **Nodes Visited:** Total number of nodes explored during the search.
   - **Path Cost:** Total cost of the resulting path (if applicable).
   - **Steps:** Users can navigate forward or backward through the animation to understand each step of the algorithm.

3. **Progress Indicator:**  
   A progress bar shows how far each algorithm has progressed in real-time.

4. **Customizable Settings:**  
   Users can adjust:
   - **Grid Size**: Number of rows and columns in the grid.
   - **Start and End Points**: Positions of the source and target nodes.
   - **Dynamic Obstacles**: Whether obstacles move during the animation.

## Algorithms Implemented

### **Uninformed Search Algorithms**

1. **BFS (Breadth-First Search):**  
   Time Complexity: O(V + E)  
   - Explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.
   - Visualization implemented with a queue-based approach.

   **Pseudocode:**
   ```plaintext
   BFS(graph, start_node):
       create a queue Q
       mark start_node as visited
       enqueue start_node into Q

       while Q is not empty:
           current_node = dequeue Q
           for each neighbor in graph.neighbors(current_node):
               if neighbor is not visited:
                   mark neighbor as visited
                   enqueue neighbor into Q
   ```

2. **DFS (Depth-First Search):**  
   Time Complexity: O(V + E)  
   - Explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.
   - Visualization implemented using recursion and a stack.

   **Pseudocode (Recursive):**
   ```plaintext
   DFS(graph, node, visited):
       mark node as visited
       for each neighbor in graph.neighbors(node):
           if neighbor is not visited:
               DFS(graph, neighbor, visited)
   ```

   **Pseudocode (Iterative):**
   ```plaintext
   DFS(graph, start_node):
       create a stack S
       push start_node onto S
       while S is not empty:
           current_node = pop S
           if current_node is not visited:
               mark current_node as visited
               for each neighbor in graph.neighbors(current_node):
                   if neighbor is not visited:
                       push neighbor onto S
   ```

### **Informed Search Algorithms**

1. **Greedy Search:**  
   Time Complexity: O(n log n)  
   - Selects the node closest to the goal based on a heuristic.  
   - May not find the optimal path.  

   **Pseudocode:**
   ```plaintext
   GreedySearch(graph, start_node, goal_node, heuristic):
       create an empty set visited
       create a priority queue Q
       enqueue start_node into Q with priority heuristic(start_node)

       while Q is not empty:
           current_node = dequeue Q
           if current_node is goal_node:
               return path from start_node to goal_node
           mark current_node as visited
           for each neighbor in graph.neighbors(current_node):
               if neighbor is not visited:
                   enqueue neighbor into Q with priority heuristic(neighbor)
   ```

2. **A\* (A-Star Search):**  
   Time Complexity: O(n log n)  
   - Combines the cost to reach a node (g) and the estimated cost to reach the goal (h).  
   - Always finds the optimal path if the heuristic is admissible.  

   **Pseudocode:**
   ```plaintext
   AStarSearch(graph, start_node, goal_node, heuristic):
       create an empty set closed_set
       create a priority queue open_set
       g_score = map with default value infinity
       g_score[start_node] = 0
       enqueue start_node into open_set with priority g_score[start_node] + heuristic(start_node)
       came_from = empty map

       while open_set is not empty:
           current_node = dequeue open_set
           if current_node is goal_node:
               return reconstruct_path(came_from, current_node)
           add current_node to closed_set
           for each neighbor in graph.neighbors(current_node):
               if neighbor in closed_set:
                   continue
               tentative_g_score = g_score[current_node] + cost(current_node, neighbor)
               if tentative_g_score < g_score[neighbor]:
                   came_from[neighbor] = current_node
                   g_score[neighbor] = tentative_g_score
                   f_score = g_score[neighbor] + heuristic(neighbor)
                   enqueue neighbor into open_set with priority f_score
   ```

3. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS):**  
   Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average, O(nÂ²) in the worst case  
   - Expands the least-cost node first, ignoring heuristics.  
   - Suitable for graphs with varying edge weights.  

   **Pseudocode:**
   ```plaintext
   UniformCostSearch(graph, start_node, goal_node):
       create a priority queue Q
       enqueue start_node into Q with priority 0
       cost_so_far = map with default value infinity
       cost_so_far[start_node] = 0
       came_from = empty map

       while Q is not empty:
           current_node = dequeue Q
           if current_node is goal_node:
               return reconstruct_path(came_from, current_node)
           for each neighbor in graph.neighbors(current_node):
               new_cost = cost_so_far[current_node] + cost(current_node, neighbor)
               if new_cost < cost_so_far[neighbor]:
                   cost_so_far[neighbor] = new_cost
                   enqueue neighbor into Q with priority new_cost
                   came_from[neighbor] = current_node
   ```
